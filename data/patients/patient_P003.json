    "text": "Patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with a palpable neck lump first noticed by her hairdresser during an appointment 10 days ago. Patient is currently asymptomatic, denying dysphagia, dyspnea, or voice changes. On physical exam, a firm, non-tender, approximately 2cm nodule is noted in the right lower pole of the thyroid. No cervical lymphadenopathy noted. Given the firm nature of the nodule, we must r/o thyroid malignancy. Plan includes serum TSH and a Thyroid Ultrasound for further characterization."
