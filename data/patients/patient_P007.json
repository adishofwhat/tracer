    "text": "SUBJECTIVE: 55-year-old male with a history of HTN presents complaining of intermittent substernal chest pressure over the last 3 days. Patient describes the sensation as a 'heavy weight' that occurs primarily during yard work but noted one episode while watching television this morning. Denies nausea, diaphoresis, or palpitations. \nOBJECTIVE: BP: 148/92, HR: 84, RR: 16, SpO2: 97% on room air. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Chest wall: No tenderness to palpation. \nASSESSMENT: Chest pain in a patient with known HTN. While the episodes are intermittent, the nature of the pain is concerning for myocardial ischemia. Differential includes stable vs. unstable angina. Must r/o ACS. \nPLAN: Order Troponin I series (baseline and 4-hour), EKG, and lipid panel. Patient instructed to report to the ER immediately if pain becomes constant or increases in severity."
