    "text": "Subjective: 80-year-old male with history of dementia brought in by daughter for acute change in mental status. Daughter reports patient is significantly more confused than baseline over the last 48 hours. Decreased oral intake and lethargy noted. No cough or clear source of infection, but patient feels warm to touch.\n\nObjective: Temp 100.1 F, HR 105, BP 108/64, RR 20, SpO2 94% on RA. Patient is alert but oriented only to person. Dry mucous membranes. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Lungs clear to auscultation. No costovertebral angle tenderness noted.\n\nAssessment: Acute encephalopathy, likely secondary to infection. Given tachycardia and borderline blood pressure, must r/o sepsis. Differential includes UTI, dehydration, or occult pneumonia.\n\nPlan: 1. Stat UA and Culture. 2. Serum Lactate to assess for tissue hypoperfusion. 3. CBC and BMP. 4. Encourage PO fluids, follow up on results within 48 hours."
