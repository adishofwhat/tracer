Patient reports increased sputum production which is thick and yellow. Denies chest pain or palpitations. Reports mild chills but has not taken temperature at home. Using Albuterol inhaler every 4 hours with minimal relief.\n\nObjective: BP 142/88, HR 94, Temp 99.2 F, SpO2 91% on room air. Resp rate 22. Exam: Alert and oriented x3. Lungs: Diminished breath sounds at bases, scattered wheezing, focal crackles noted in the right lower field. Heart: Regular rhythm, no murmurs. Trace edema in lower extremities.\n\nAssessment: Elderly male with baseline COPD presenting with acute respiratory symptoms. r/o pneumonia vs COPD exacerbation. Differentials include CHF and bronchitis.\n\nPlan: 1. Order CXR PA/Lateral. 2. CBC with differential. 3. Start Azithromycin 500mg daily x 5 days. 4. Continue current COPD regimen and Albuterol PRN. 5. Patient instructed to call if symptoms worsen or fever develops."

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Stable appearance of chronic hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms consistent with known COPD. IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Clinical correlation required."
