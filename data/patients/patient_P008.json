Patient reports mild fatigue but denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Noticed occasional peripheral edema in bilateral ankles in the evening. Objective: BP 148/92, HR 76, Temp 98.4. Lungs clear to auscultation. 1+ pitting edema noted at the ankles. Assessment: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with borderline hypertension. Plan: Order BMP to monitor kidney function and HbA1c to assess glycemic control. Adjust lisinopril if blood pressure remains elevated."
