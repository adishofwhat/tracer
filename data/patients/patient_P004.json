    "text": "SUBJECTIVE: Patient is a 50-year-old female presenting with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) that began yesterday evening after returning from an 11-hour flight from London. She reports mild pleuritic chest pain but denies cough or fever. PMH significant for DVT in 2019 following a knee arthroscopy; not currently on anticoagulation. OBJECTIVE: Vitals: BP 132/88, HR 104, RR 20, Temp 98.6, SpO2 93% on room air. Exam: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs. Extremities: Minimal swelling of the right lower extremity, no focal calf tenderness. ASSESSMENT: 50F with SOB and tachycardia post-long-haul flight. Wells score is elevated given history of DVT and clinical tachycardia. Differential includes pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or pleurisy. Need to r/o PE. PLAN: 1. Stat D-Dimer 2. EKG 3. CT Angio Chest. Patient instructed to go to the imaging center immediately."
