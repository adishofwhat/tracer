    "text": "SUBJECTIVE: 60-year-old male with a history of DM2 presents complaining of progressive blurry vision over the last 4 months. Patient notes difficulty reading and seeing street signs while driving. Denies acute vision loss, floaters, or eye pain. Admits to inconsistent monitoring of blood glucose levels recently. OBJECTIVE: BP 138/86, HR 78, BMI 31. Eyes: Bilateral visual acuity 20/50 without correction. Conjunctivae clear. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Fundoscopic exam in office reveals some possible microaneurysms, but view is limited. ASSESSMENT: 1. Visual disturbance in a patient with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Differential includes cataracts vs. diabetic retinopathy. 2. DM2, suboptimal control. PLAN: Refer to Ophthalmology for comprehensive dilated eye exam to screen retinopathy and assess for macular edema. Ordered HbA1c and BMP to evaluate current metabolic state."
