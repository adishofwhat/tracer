PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: STEMI (Myocardial Infarction)\n2. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES: Aortic Dissection, PE\n3. KEY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE: Crushing chest pain, ST elevation on EKG\n4. URGENCY LEVEL: High\n5. TESTS ORDERED: EKG, Troponin\n6.

Reports 12-pound weight loss over past 3 months despite no change in diet or exercise. States she feels \"tired all the time\" and has noticed decreased energy for usual activities. Appetite has been \"just okay\" - not increased but eating normal amounts. Denies fever, night sweats, or rigors. No recent travel. Family history notable for mother with colon cancer diagnosed at age 65.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVitals: BP 138/84, HR 92, Temp 98.4\u00b0F, RR 16, O2 Sat 98% RA\nWeight: 142 lbs (previous visit 3 months ago: 154 lbs)\nGeneral: Appears mildly fatigued but alert and oriented\nHEENT: Conjunctiva appear pale bilaterally. Oral mucosa moist.\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs\nPulm: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nAbd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No palpable masses. Normal bowel sounds.\nExt: No edema, peripheral pulses intact\nSkin: Pale, no rashes or lesions\n\nASSESSMENT:\nThis is a 58-year-old woman with concerning constellation of constitutional symptoms including significant unintentional weight loss (12 lbs over 3 months, approximately 8% body weight) and persistent fatigue. Given family history of colon cancer in first-degree relative and age over 50, I am concerned for possible occult gastrointestinal malignancy. Rule out colon cancer versus other GI malignancy such as gastric cancer. Differential diagnosis also includes lymphoma given B symptoms (weight loss, fatigue), though she denies night sweats. Other considerations include severe nutritional deficiency, hyperthyroidism, or chronic infection, but malignancy is highest on differential given constellation of findings.\n\nPLAN:\n1. Laboratory workup:\n   - Complete blood count with differential (assess for anemia)\n   - Comprehensive metabolic panel (assess organ function, nutritional status)\n   - TSH (rule out thyroid dysfunction)\n2. Imaging:\n   - Chest X-ray PA and lateral (baseline imaging, assess for lymphadenopathy or pulmonary lesion)\n3. Gastrointestinal evaluation:\n   - Referral to gastroenterology for colonoscopy (expedited given family history and red flag symptoms)\n4. Follow-up in 1 week to review laboratory results and ensure colonoscopy is scheduled\n5. Patient educated on red flag symptoms (worsening fatigue, abdominal pain, blood in stool, fever) and instructed to call or present to ED if these develop\n\nPatient counseled on importance of completing colonoscopy given family history and current symptoms.

      "notes": "Correctly linked Anemia + Colonoscopy",
      "output": "---\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **CBC Findings:** The patient presents with symptoms (weight loss, fatigue, pale conjunctiva) and a family history suggestive of colon cancer. The CBC reveals a microcytic anemia (low Hgb, low MCV) with elevated RDW. This pattern is highly suggestive of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA can be a sign of chronic blood loss, potentially from the GI tract (including the colon), or it could be related to other underlying conditions. In the context of weight loss and concern for malignancy, IDA warrants further investigation, possibly including iron studies (ferritin, TIBC, transferrin saturation) and potentially a fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) to assess for GI bleeding. While the anemia itself is not diagnostic of colon cancer, it is a significant finding that requires further evaluation in this clinical scenario.\n\n2.  **Chest X-ray Finding:** The chest X-ray shows mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy, with the largest node measuring 1.2 cm in the right paratracheal region. This finding is noted, but it is described as \"mild\" and \"nonspecific\" in the report. While lymphadenopathy can be associated with malignancy, especially in the context of weight loss, this finding alone is not diagnostic. The report suggests considering a CT chest if clinically indicated, which is reasonable given the patient's symptoms. However, the lymphadenopathy is not the primary concern based on the current information. The lungs are clear, which is reassuring.\n\n3.  **Pending Colonoscopy:** The patient has undergone a referral to gastroenterology for a colonoscopy, which was ordered 14 days ago. The fact that the colonoscopy has not yet been completed is significant. It suggests a delay in the diagnostic workup for the patient's symptoms, which could be related to a potential malignancy. The lack of a completed colonoscopy is a point of concern and may indicate logistical issues or prioritization challenges.\n\n4.  **Next Steps:** Given the patient's symptoms (weight loss, fatigue), family history, and the finding of iron deficiency anemia, the most crucial next step is to proceed with the scheduled colonoscopy. This is the primary investigation for ruling out colon cancer in this patient.\n    *   **Prioritize Colonoscopy:** Ensure the patient is scheduled for and attends the colonoscopy as soon as possible.\n    *"

The test has not been performed, and the patient has not been contacted or scheduled. This constitutes a failure in the diagnostic process.\n2.  **High Risk:** Delaying the colonoscopy increases the risk of missing a potential colon cancer diagnosis, which could lead to a later stage of the disease and worse prognosis.

This ensures the necessary investigation is proceeding.\n4.  **Urgent:** The delay is significant (14 days without follow-up), and the potential consequences of a missed diagnosis are serious, making this an urgent situation requiring prompt action.\n\n---\n\n**Follow-up Action:**\n\n*   **Contact the referring physician:**\n    *   Inquire about the status of the ordered colonoscopy.\n    *   Ask about the patient's follow-up plan and whether they have been contacted.\n    *   Confirm if the patient has been scheduled.\n*   **If the colonoscopy has not been performed:**\n    *   Advise the physician to prioritize scheduling the procedure.\n    *   Suggest contacting the patient to confirm their understanding of the importance of the test and to schedule the appointment.\n*   **If the colonoscopy has been performed:**\n    *   Ask for the results.\n    *   If results are available, inquire about the patient's follow-up and management plan.\n    *   If results are pending, inquire"
