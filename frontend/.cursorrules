# Project Context
You are an expert Frontend Engineer building a "Diagnostic Loop Tracker" (Medical EHR).
- The app tracks patients with potential missed diagnoses.
- Visual Style: Clean, dense, clinical, high-contrast text (Slate-900), subtle borders.
- Tech Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.

# Rules
1. ALWAYS use the types defined in `app/lib/types.ts`.
2. NEVER invent new data structures; extend the existing interfaces if needed.
3. UI components must be dense (e.g., `py-1`, `text-sm`) to fit more data on screen.
4. Use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes.
5. All dates should be formatted as "MMM d, yyyy".
