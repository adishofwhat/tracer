Denies fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Last menstrual period 7 weeks ago, normally regular cycles.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVitals: BP 118/72, HR 98, Temp 98.4\u00b0F, RR 16\nGeneral: Moderate distress due to pain\nAbdomen: Right lower quadrant tenderness, no rebound or guarding, no masses palpated\nPelvic: Minimal blood in vault, closed cervical os, right adnexal tenderness, no masses palpated\n\nASSESSMENT: Early pregnancy with right lower quadrant pain and vaginal spotting. Differential includes ectopic pregnancy, threatened abortion, ovarian cyst rupture, or appendicitis. Ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out given location of pain and early gestational age.\n\nPLAN: Quantitative beta-hCG to confirm pregnancy and assess level. Transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate for intrauterine pregnancy vs ectopic. Type and screen given potential for bleeding. Patient stable for outpatient workup. If beta-hCG >1500 and no IUP seen on ultrasound, concerning for ectopic. Instructed to return immediately if pain worsens, heavy bleeding, or lightheadedness. OB-GYN to follow up on results."

Associated with nausea, especially in morning. Reports visual changes - occasional blurred vision and double vision. Denies trauma. Works as software engineer, attributes symptoms initially to stress and screen time.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nVitals: BP 158/92, HR 88, Temp 98.4\u00b0F\nNeurologic: \n- Mental status: Alert, oriented x3\n- Cranial nerves: CN VI palsy noted bilaterally (limited abduction both eyes), other CNs intact\n- Motor: 5/5 strength throughout\n- Sensory: Intact\n- Cerebellar: Mild dysmetria on finger-to-nose bilaterally\n- Fundoscopy: Bilateral papilledema with blurred disc margins\n\nASSESSMENT: Morning headaches with nausea, papilledema, and CN VI palsies concerning for increased intracranial pressure. Sixth nerve palsies are false localizing signs of elevated ICP. Differential includes brain tumor, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (less likely in male), hydrocephalus, or cerebral venous thrombosis. Papilledema requires urgent neuroimaging.\n\nPLAN: MRI brain with and without contrast to evaluate for mass lesion or hydrocephalus. Neurology referral urgently. BP elevated - may be reactive to ICP. Advised to go to ER immediately if headache suddenly worsens, vision loss, or seizure occurs. Avoid aspirin or NSAIDs until imaging complete."
